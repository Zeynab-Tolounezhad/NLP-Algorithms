# Probabilistic Language Modeling (N_gram):
Statistical language models, in its essence, are the type of models that assign probabilities to the sequences of words.
You can think of an N-gram as the sequence of N words, by that notion, a 2-gram (or bigram) is a two-word sequence of words like “please turn”, “turn your”, or ”your homework”, and a 3-gram (or trigram) is a three-word sequence of words like “please turn your”, or “turn your homework”
